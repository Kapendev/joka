# Append & Remove

Run with:

```sh
./run 1000000000
# Or: ./run 100000000
```

## Note

By default it will only run some of the files because not every language can handle 1B items with their default dynamic array.
Install these tools before running the test:

- D: ldc2
- Rust: rustc
- Zig: zig
- Odin: odin
